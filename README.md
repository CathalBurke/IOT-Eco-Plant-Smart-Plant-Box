This project is a fully automated smart plant care system developed using ESP32 microcontrollers, C++, and sensor networks. It monitors and adjusts soil moisture, light, temperature, and humidity in real time.

Features:

Automated watering system using soil moisture sensors

Live data streaming to a custom-built web interface (ESP32-hosted)

Alerts & logs based on thresholds

Real-time environmental tracking

Modular code architecture for scalability

Technology used:

Microcontroller: ESP32

Languages: C++, HTML/CSS (Web Interface), Arduino Framework

Sensors: DHT11 (Humidity/Temp), Soil Moisture, Light Sensor

Web: Hosted on ESP32, served via local IP with real-time updates

Skills Demonstrated:

Embedded system design

IoT network architecture

Sensor integration

Full-stack development (hardware + software)

Automation and real-time decision-making
